# HawkingBeta

This is code for an FRC Robot developed by 4910 (our Power Up season bot, Hawking) for beta testing 2021 WpiLib features. We need to clean up the branches and merge the good stuff to master. If you dig through the branches you will find our work on the drive train, our testing of the new state space controller with our elevator (it works beautifully and we hope to post a video with an explaination of the new feature!), and the code that we used to make the demonstration video at https://youtu.be/1z06JJ1cntw. Hopefully we can clean up this repository before the season starts!
